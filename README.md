# Chirp App

## Core Requirements

- [x] Allow visitors to the app to create a new chirp with custom text
- [x] Allow visitors to view existing chirps list Chirps list should display to users newest-at-top.
- [x] Chirps must be CAPS ONLY.
- [ ] After persisting to the database, use an external API to send push notifications to phones.
- [ ] Implement this by using our HTTP service
- [ ] Allow visitors to upvote chirps

## Nice to Haves

- [ ] The app preferably uses AJAX for creating new chirps, viewing chirps, listing chirps
- [ ] Well styled application with good usability and design Write tests for the application
- [ ] Order list of chirps by a reddit-like algorithm that takes into account both recency and number of upvotes
- [ ] Allow users to unvote chirps they've previously upvoted
